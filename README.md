# Muhammad Farooq

Hello — I'm Muhammad Farooq. I'm currently learning Data Science and SQL. This repository (or profile) is where I keep notes, practice projects, and examples as I learn and build experience.

## About me
- Name: Muhammad Farooq
- Currently learning: Data Science, SQL
- GitHub: @MuhammadFarooq51

## Current focus
- Fundamentals of statistics and probability
- Data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- SQL for data extraction, joins, aggregation, and window functions
- Introduction to machine learning (supervised learning, basic models)
- Data visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn, or similar)

## Skills (in progress)
- Python (pandas, numpy)
- SQL (SELECT, JOINs, GROUP BY, window functions)
- Data visualization basics
- Basic machine learning concepts (linear regression, classification)

## Projects (ideas / placeholders)
- SQL practice queries: small files with example queries and explanations
- EDA notebooks: load a public dataset, clean it, visualize distributions, and write conclusions
- Mini machine learning project: predict a simple target (e.g., house prices or classification) with a notebook that shows steps from data cleaning to evaluation
- Dashboard prototype: simple visual dashboard using a plotting library or a lightweight framework

## Learning plan (short-term)
1. Solidify SQL basics: focus on joins, aggregation, subqueries, and window functions  
2. Build reproducible EDA notebooks for 2–3 datasets  
3. Learn a simple ML pipeline: preprocessing → model → evaluation  
4. Document each project with a README and short summary

## Resources I use / recommend
- SQLBolt / Mode SQL tutorials
- Kaggle datasets and notebooks
- "Python for Data Analysis" by Wes McKinney (pandas)
- Coursera / edX courses on Data Science fundamentals

## How to use this repo
- Keep each project in its own folder with a README describing dataset, steps, and conclusions
- Store SQL scripts in a `sql/` directory, notebooks in `notebooks/`, and any small datasets in `data/` (or provide links to larger datasets)
- Add a `notes/` folder for short tips, query snippets, and useful commands
